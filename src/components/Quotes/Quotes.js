                Safar knew how to perfectly meet my expectations as a web designer! Beautiful proposals and intelligent suggestions from him, allowed us to refine my product (website) and to engage better visibility on our main objective. Respect for good practices and its availability made it a superb service provider for our project.

                I was surprised at Safar's skills and his ability to meet the deadlines he had offered us. We gave him a fairly precise and complex task which he was able to accomplish in a few days. Safar accompanied us until the installation of the product, something that was not even agreed in our contract. Safar combines skills, listening and availability which make him an excellent freelancer!

            <p>
            After a few months of internship I learned one thing. You have to know how to pick up, write and perform.
            </p>
            <p>
            Projects allow<strong> to learn</strong>,
              <strong> to exchange</strong> and <strong>performer</strong> It is for me a way of evacuating my "ideas" that goes through my head (even if it sucks, I need it), to learn new technologies but also to exchange with a lot of people on my ideas and improve them.
            </p>
            <p>
            Having the idea is simple, developing it, maintaining and releasing the product has a lot less. It takes time, reflection but also support! This is why I make my open-source projects as much as possible now, that I exchange my projects as much as possible on social networks.
